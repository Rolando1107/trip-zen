## Installation
There are no installation instructions at this time, visiting the URL provided in the repository is all that is needed as this is a full-stack deployed application.

## Usage
TZ login is located on the top righthand side of the screen (if you do not already have an account, signup is available). The home screen provides a searchbar and an interactive map. Upon search, TZ will show you a short bio, including a quick blurb about what the destination is known for, the current weather and weather description, a link for travel-info (reviews, photos, nearby points of interest, flights), and also an option to Save the destination to your list, which can be accessed via the sidebar.
